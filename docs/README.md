This Privacy Policy explains how Photo Wrapped (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our mobile application (“the App”). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that any personal information we collect is handled responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws.

## 1. Information We Collect
1.1 Information You Provide to Us

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

- App Functionality: To enable the App’s features, such as detecting faces in photos, creating your monthly photo collage, and facilitating sharing to social media platforms like Instagram.
- App Improvement: To understand how users engage with the App and to develop new features, fix bugs, and improve overall performance.
- Customer Support: To assist you if you contact us with questions, feedback, or issues related to the App.

## 5. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect against loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
